User Statistics: Tracks user-specific information, including counts of "INFO" and "ERROR" messages.
CSV Reports: Generates CSV reports for error messages and user statistics for further analysis.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/hajarbouchriha/security-automation-script.git
cd security-automation-script
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Run the script:
